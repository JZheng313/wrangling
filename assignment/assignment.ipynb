        "1. This paper is about data tidying, what it is and its advantanges.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard has been designed to \"facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The first sentence means that messy data often creates problems, while clean data can be manipulated and used similarly. The second sentence says that the idea of a \"Data frame/matrix\" may be intuitive, but in reality, it would be way more beneficial if the analyst puts in the effort to consicously make decisions and conduct rational thinking.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Values are usually \"either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative) and are typically organized in two ways. Every value belongs to a variable and an observation. A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units. An observation contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "5. In section 2.3, tidy data is defined as a \"standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure. In tidy data: each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observation unit forms a table.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are:\n",
        ">* \"Column headers are values, not variable names.\n",
        ">* Multiple variables are stored in one column.\n",
        ">* Variables are stored in both rows and columns.\n",
        ">* Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.\n",
        ">* A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data in Table 4 is messy because it's \"tabular data designed for presentation, where variables form both the rows and columns, and columns headers are values not variable names\". \"'Melting' a dataset or stacking it means that we need to turn columns into rows.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Table 11 has days along the top, which are values. Table 12 melts those days into a single variable, date. However, Table 12(a) is molten and not tidy because the element variable contains variable names and not values. On the other hand, 12(b) is tidy because all the entries are attributes and not variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. \"If tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will be inextricably linked to tidy data\". Wickham wants a broader philosophy of data cleaning and hopes that the tidy concept isn't just about training people to use ggplot2 effectively, but in creating a bigger and more robust ecosystem of ideas and tools for data science in general."
